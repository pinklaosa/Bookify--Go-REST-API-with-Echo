# Book API with Golang and Echo

This is a Book Management API built with Golang using the Echo framework. It follows a clean architecture with separate layers for handlers, services, and repositories. The database is PostgreSQL, and the project uses Viper for configuration management.

## Features

- CRUD operations for books
- Category management
- Retrieve books with their category names
- PostgreSQL integration with GORM
- Configuration management using Viper
- Structured logging with Zap
- Authentication using JWT (Planned)
- Unit tests (Planned)
- Docker support (Planned)
- API documentation with Swagger (Planned)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Golang (>=1.18)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (Optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pinklaosa/book-api.git
   cd book-api
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Set up PostgreSQL using Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Update `config/config.yaml` with your database credentials.

5. Run the project:
   ```sh
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

### API Endpoints

#### Books

## Environment Configuration

The project uses Viper for configuration. Modify `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
app:
  port: 8080

database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  user: myuser
  password: mypassword
  dbname: mydatabase
  sslmode: disable
```

## Future Improvements

- Implement JWT authentication
- Add unit tests
- Improve error handling
- Dockerize the application
- Integrate Swagger for API documentation
